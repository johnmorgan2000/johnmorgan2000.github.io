    a student at Base Camp Coding Academy in Water Valley, MS. Here at BCCA, we work hard 8 hours a day, 5 
    days a week for 11 months doing hands-on programming to build our skills. I am comfortable with a wide range of full-stack web technologies and you can see some of my work below. If you have any
