    bio: `Hello there, my name is John Morgan and welcome to my portfolio. After graduating with honors from Charleston High School
    in 2018, I enrolled at Base Camp Coding Academy. The instructors here work vey hard to ensure that
    we have all the necessary qualities and experience to get hired as developers. So far this year,
    I have learned to write code in python, html, css, and javascript. By the time I finish this program,
    I expect to know many more languages ,as well as, how to be a more professional worker in order to
    be the most competent programmer I can be.`,
